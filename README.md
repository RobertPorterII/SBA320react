This project was simple and hard at the same time, the plan in my head and code had mentally worked out that i  thought would work once i could retrieve the data , ended up time sink that  i just couldnt fix and ended up basically having to start over. that be being said I wanted a Simpple Anime Search App and that what i have made , using the Jikan API ( https://jikan.moe/), It free and open sourced but something about some of those query paramaters listed in Doc dont seem to perform the searches or filtering they are suppose to but oh well still works for teh most part and no APi key needed

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
